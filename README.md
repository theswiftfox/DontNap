Indicator for Wingpanel to quickly disable sleep settings.  

Inspired by the popular application [caffeine](https://launchpad.net/caffeine) I decided to write a small indicator application for [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) using their wingpanel API.  
On enabling the 'Prevent Sleep' option the application will store your current settings for inactivity and update the gsettings temporarily and restore your settings if you disable it or close the application (shutdown).  

This is my first application for elementary OS and written for personal use. So use at your own risk. But I am always open for suggestions on improvements.
